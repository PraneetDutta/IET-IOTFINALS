The given files are for my Presentation for "Urban Pollution Monitoring Using the Internet of Things".My Solution 
Involves the Use of Analytics Models to Build Mathematical Models of Pollution Levels.The Files Consist of:-

1)Code for Pollution Level Monitoring on a Random City and Building a Regression Models to determine the Levels
2)Natural Language Processing -Turning Twitter Feed into Useful Data/Information about levels in Certain Parts of an Urban Population
3)Arduino Code using the GUI(Embedded C) for WiFi Connectivity
